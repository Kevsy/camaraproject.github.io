# camaraproject.github.io

Repository to host the Swagger UI to display API definition files (YAML) in a user friendly way.

## Notes for editors

swagger-initializer.js has been adapted to reject rendering of any YAML files that are outside the
CAMARA project.

User Interface can be edited at swagger-ui.css.
